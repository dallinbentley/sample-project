    content:
      'In the time before time, the cosmos exhaled and the breath became the land of Wellze. The mountains rose as the first thought, the oceans filled as the first feeling, and the forests grew as the first dream. The oldest spirits say that Wellze is not a place but a living being, and all who dwell within it are simply its fleeting memories.',

    content:
      'Historical records confirm that crystal magic was not invented but discovered by accident when the shepherd Elden sought shelter in a mountain cave during a blizzard. The crystals responded to his fear and pain, healing his frostbitten fingers and illuminating the darkness. Elden spent three days in the cave learning to communicate with the crystals before emerging to share his discovery with the world.',

      'The sentient trees of the Whispering Woods have spoken of a sixth element beyond fire, water, earth, air, and void: the element of Memory. They claim that when a mortal learns to wield Memory as an element, the boundaries between ages will dissolve and Wellze will remember its true purpose. No scholar has been able to determine whether this is prophecy or metaphor.',

      'Fishermen along the Azure Coast speak of a melody that rises from the deep on the calmest nights, a song so beautiful that those who hear it weep without knowing why. The legend holds that the ocean spirits sing to remember the world that existed before Wellze, a world of pure water that chose to become land so that new forms of life could walk upon it.',

      'The foundational technique of crystal magic, Resonance Attunement requires the caster to empty their mind and hum a single sustained note while touching a crystal. If the note matches the crystal\'s natural frequency, a bond forms and the caster can channel magic through the stone. Masters can attune to multiple crystals simultaneously, creating complex harmonic spells.',

Miners who sleep too close to the stones report vivid shared dreams of a world made entirely of fire, where beings of living flame build cities and compose symphonies.

It states that when the Crystal Heart fully reassembles, its resonance will vibrate at the exact frequency needed to reopen the rift.
